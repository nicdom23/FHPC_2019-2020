#  I/O profiling and benchmarking  


##  Lecture for the course scientific data management 

## OUTLINE

This lecture give some information how to profile and benchmark I/O system on HPC platform and how to profile applications which requires/uses I/O resources 

## SLIDES

## Practical session

In this practical session we will profile some scientific application  by means of some i/o profilers

 - [profile ior application with darshan] 
 - [profile some scientific application using darshan]
