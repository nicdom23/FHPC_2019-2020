Using perf

You have to see how the esxecutavbel performs on a certain hardware.Modern high end provessors give some tools to test this inside and outside cpu incore and outcore events.
PMUs performance monitoring units.
Precide event base samoling.what instruction precisely causes that cache missing

Cpu inside has PMU,
inside Kernel contains PErf_events,msr, different sep dricer. Machine independent ApIs,like PAPI, libfm4,like likwid
Program how to access directly


PERF performance eveents for linux.Standard interface, give me branch misses and ither data. call perf to execute the code, much berter ro use papi.

perf profiles at assembly level rhe code. precide table if efvents line b y line.
command line PERF


perf list first column: short command dcahche=data cahce icache= instruction cache a lot if info lisr is quitr long,,, not enough,,,retired, branch instruction, flush everitying back:: top down analysis made by perf

version of perf relates to the length o

What to ask? ask those questions

workflow
Run the program and collect as many data as possible

event based profiling vs sample based profiling

each
Translation lookaside buffer



sample based:use record insteead of stat
perf record .f
