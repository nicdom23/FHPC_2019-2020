benchmark:standardized way to compare performance of different systems

HPL HIGh PERFORMANce LINPACK  good benchmark to 
now input output benchmark
hpl is no more relevant

should be simple portable and scalable
actually adapt it to a different size of the system
consistent and repeatable results
accepted by users

synthethic workload benchmark

mosti important applicatiion based benchmark

microbenchmark like stream

discuss IO benchmark io is the weak part of the chain
io perfotmance harder than cpu an memory benchmark
io performance relies on complicated -io stack

io library

RAID infrastrucure has a cache Into the DISK
on a single io server


parallel filesystem is more complex at least three different stuff
which kind of network are we using 
a lot of different layers, complicates to measure numbers
IO library is user
RAID infrastructure on the hardware

how to test, perform high level benchmark, how is the stack build
benchmark alls tructures on the stack

which performance can i get from the disk

combine all numbers toghether and get a performance model and some expected values
We run the high level benchmark and compare with you have built

enable raid infrastructure and measure its raw perfomance
the disk has a certain MB/s set up file system and go down to 180

think about a cluster where you have a lot of clients and of servers and a vast network

benchmark all the single components, get a common result, compare with the benchmark

what is the network occupation, maybe i have to decide on a separated network
metadata iops vs bandwidth, not so gigantic files on which io operations are important


benchmark your own application 
very complicated, moving data takes days, very hard to standardise and distribute

you have to benchmark your own workload, first thing get a grant to run an application, all this runs in the time they gave me - do a benchmark analysis- very large grant need benchmark processing; again in IO
----
program scales well keep constant the io operations, the problem doesnt scale anymore

increase the number of processors the green part increases while the rest remains really small, it doesnt scale because it is poorly parallelied by the IO part
remove the IO part  collect the data and reduce the number of processors that write

kind of situation youre dealing with

do benchmark of your stuff  

io performance measurements so many sequential bands
single shared files lot of dim

a method that says how much des it take to run the application

what kind of IO the application does
find the right benchmark;;

no one size fits all solution to the io problem√π
no find the right machine that can work for everything
many io patterns work well for some range of parameters.
conflicts with increase performance by decreasing number of IO operations and increasing size


microbenchmarks to play  use iozone
lustre to stripe the file over different osd

try to compile iozone and try to use scratch

IOR the the facto IO banchmark for HPC

i have three tasks
blocksize = blocksize filesystem

ior is a parallel appliction 
write a file that is large as

one file per process, instead of writing a shared file sistem i write independent files

the performance increases bandwidth
each single process writes its one file 
parallel approach, ditruibute the single files for many differetn osd
why such a large difference in terms of writing and reading: in the first read is five times faster than write
why do i have a write speed of
why? buffering save the file in the buffer and when reading finds data in buffer, wrong benchmarking, measure whole filesystem, deal with small files
consider what you can get out the system

you can play some flags

mdtest measures metadata performance  you say that every process will create state and remove do this

run test  on 2 filesystems

on a lot of small files luster is not woring well im so slow at creating metadata
